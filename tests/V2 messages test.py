They allow you to have full control over the layout of your messages.\n\nOur previous components system, while functional, had limitations:\n- Content, attachments, embeds, and components had to follow fixed positioning rules\n- Visual styling options were limited\n\nOur new component system addresses these challenges with fully composable components that can be arranged and laid out in any order, allowing for a more flexible and visually appealing design. Check out the [changelog](https://discord.com/developers/docs/change-log) for more details."
